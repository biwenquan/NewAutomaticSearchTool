1.Run "hight-impossible-dc.py"(need MILPSbox.pyc and on windows with python 3.*) to get 
"hight-impossible-dc-17.lp"(The model file of 17 round impossbile-differential cryptanalysis
of hight).

2.Run shell script "17r-impossible.sh" to get the input and output pair of impossible trails
in "result". If the trail is impossible, it will print 'infeasible' just below the trail.

PS1:In "17r-impossible.sh", you should set your gurobi.sh path to run on your linux system.
